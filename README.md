A website application which is written in Java and Using Tomcat to build this website.

It contains three primary functions now.

I deleted some bootstrap files, if there are some bugs happen. Just download whole bootstrap files to the bootstrap folder. 

THIS THE LINK OF THE WEBSITE IS NOT THE NEWEST VERSION.
THE NEWEST CODE OF THIS WEBSITE IS ON THIS PAGE, MY GITHUB, RATHER THAN THE WEBSITE.

# Message Board

Using MySQL to store the information of messages. Now it can show the title, text, writer and time.

Will add delete function in the future.

# Chatroom

Using websocket to create page.
I know its UI is very bad. I will improve it in the future.

# Ragnarok: A small JavaScript Game

Using JavaScript to make Thor move and attack. you can find its Js code here: https://github.com/Jiachenggavin/Games_Js

# About this website
All the pages are written in the original CSS3 and JavaScript without any architecture.

This website is just for testing and improving my coding skills for the website.

The UI of the home page is improving now. My plan is using bootstrap to make it more beautiful.

Other pages will be improved in the future, too.

The next plan is re-writing all JSP files to Ajax.

# About this website
All the pages are written in the original CSS3 and JavaScript without any architecture.

This website is just for testing and improving my coding skills for website.

The UI of home page is improving now. My plan is using bootstrap to make it more beautiful.

Other pages will be improve in the future, too.

The next plan is re-writting all JSP files to Ajax.
